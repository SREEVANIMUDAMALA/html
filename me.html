<p>A plantation is an agricultural estate,<b> generally centered on a plantation house,</b> meant for farming that specializes in cash crops,<u> usually mainly planted with a single crop,</u> with perhaps ancillary areas for vegetables for eating and so on. <i>The crops that are grown include cotton, cannabis, coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar cane, opium, sisal, oil seeds, oil palms, fruits, rubber trees and forest trees.</i><br> Protectionist policies and natural comparative advantage have sometimes contributed to determining where plantations are located.</br></p>
